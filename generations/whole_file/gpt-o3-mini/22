# Testcase Example:  '"WBBWWBBWBW"\n7'
#
# You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is
# either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the i^th block. The characters
# 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.
# 
# You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive
# black blocks.
# 
# In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black
# block.
# 
# Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least
# one occurrence of k consecutive black blocks.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and
# 4th blocks
# so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
# It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in
# less than 3 operations.
# Therefore, we return 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
# Therefore, we return 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == blocks.length
# 1 <= n <= 100
# blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B'.
# 1 <= k <= n
# 
#

class Solution:
    def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the count of 'W' in the first window
        count = blocks[:k].count('W')
        result = count
        
        # Slide the window across the string
        for i in range(k, len(blocks)):
            if blocks[i] == 'W':
                count += 1
            if blocks[i - k] == 'W':
                count -= 1
            result = min(result, count)
            
        return result
